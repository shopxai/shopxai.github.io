          <h2>The GenAI Shopping Gap: Engagement Without Conversion</h2>
          <p>
            In 2025, 38% of online shoppers are using Generative AI to research products.
            These AI-powered shoppers spend 10% more time browsing your site than traditional customers.
            But increased engagement doesn’t automatically translate to conversions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shopt bridges this critical gap by transforming extended browsing sessions into confident
            purchase decisions with personalized guidance and product expertise delivered exactly when
            shoppers need it.

            <h3>Compress Research Time</h3>
            <p>
              Complex purchases—from electronics to furniture to skincare—can take consumers weeks or months
              to research. Shopt shortens this cycle by educating shoppers, explaining product tradeoffs, and
              intelligently narrowing their options.

              Our AI learns from your product catalog, specifications, and customer reviews to provide instant
              answers to questions that normally require hours of comparison shopping, resulting in shorter
              consideration periods and faster conversions.
